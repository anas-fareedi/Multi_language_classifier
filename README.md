# Project Title

A multilingual text classifier that identifies whether a given sentence is in English, French, or German using transformer-based embeddings and a fine-tuned classification model.

## Overview

This project focuses on language identification across multiple European languages. It uses a pretrained transformer model to learn language patterns
and classify input text with high accuracy. The pipeline includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and a simple inference script for classifying new sentences.

## Features

Supports English, French, and German
Transformer-based multilingual classification
Clean preprocessing pipeline
High-accuracy text predictions
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)
Easy inference script for classifying new sentences
Modular codebase for adding more languages or models
